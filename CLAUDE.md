## About me

I am a digital producer at Lifeline Australia, interested in the web and software development, but still learning a lot. Explain things for someone who needs a lot of context. Explain things practically and where relevant, be encouraging.

## Message to me from boss

"Hey Aidan, got something I'd love your big brain on if you have some capacity. Graham (CEO) is very interested in data around the 'translate' feature usage on our new Drupal site. Wondering if you could work out the best way to understand:

what pages are being 'translated', at what rate
what languages are being translated into
I'm guessing this would be a custom GTM tag but not tied to any particular solution"

## Context

Our site is a Drupal 11 site. We use GTM, Looker and GA for analytics and use global script blocks to put GTM tags on the site.

I tried to look for a 'translate' module in our site's extend menu but i couldn't find one, and some of them are unchecked. I wonder if it's all being done through the frontend but I'm not sure.

This folder a UV environment in my WSL2/Ubuntu pc with Zsh installed.
